This project, "The War Table Microcosm" (sand-box-microcosm), is a personal thought experiment and a living portfolio by Hong Lin.

## **Core Intent: A Monument for Learning, Not a Tool for Production**

This work is shared with the world for one purpose and one purpose only: **for educational, demonstrative, and inspirational purposes.**

It is an "artwork" to be studied, a "map" to be explored, a "story" to be read.
It is **NOT** a production-ready, open-source tool intended for direct use in commercial or operational environments.

## **Permissions**

You are free to:
*   **Learn from it:** Fork it, read it, analyze it, and use its architectural patterns and philosophical concepts as inspiration for your own work.
*   **Discuss it:** Share it, write about it, and engage in thoughtful conversation about its ideas.

## **Restrictions**

You are **NOT** permitted to:
*   Use this software, in whole or in part, for any commercial purpose.
*   Incorporate this software into any production system.
*   Expect any form of support, warranty, or maintenance.

This is not a community project. This is a curated exhibition. Please, enjoy the tour.
